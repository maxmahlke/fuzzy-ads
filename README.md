Make queries from the command line as in the webbrowser

    $ ads -q "author:^livingston year:2010-2022"

or use ADS abbreviations such as `-y|--year`,`-fa|--first-author`, `-a|--author`:

    $ ads -fa jenkins -y 2020

Then fuzzy-search the results based on year, author, and title. Use `<c-r>` to get only refereed articles and `<c-f>` to get non-refereed results only.
Results without open-access PDFs available are dimmed in the search prompt. See `ads --help` more information.
